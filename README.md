# Artist-Attribution

The growth of digital music platforms has led to an enormous collection of songs from various artists, necessitating accurate attribution of songs to their respective creators. Even when isolated from the audio signal of the song, lyrics retain a substantial amount of information. This project delves into the artist attribution through the application of machine learning techniques, employing lyrics and genre information as primary features, along with derived attributes such as profanity and love/politeness scores, for classification against artist name as ground truth label. The study leverages the Word2Vec method for vectorizing lyrics and adopts the Random Forest and SVM algorithms as the classification models. By collecting data from Spotify APIs and utilizing web scraping on Genius.com, a comprehensive dataset was obtained. The primary goal of the project was to achieve precise artist attribution while also exploring the impact of lyrics and genre on the modelâ€™s classification performance. We were able to achieve an accuracy of 42.01% with Top3 accuracy being 55.70% and Top-5 accuracy being 62.11% without genre and 64.97% with Top-3 accuracy being 82.38% and Top-5 accuracy being 88.26%. Alongside, analyzing artist collaboration networks, hints of poor attribution were found when artists have a high degree of collaboration.
